    <h3>New York City</h3>

    <p>
      My dream home is a classic New York City brownstone, nestled on a quiet,
      tree-lined street with ivy creeping up its historic façade. There's
      something timeless and grounding about the architecture—each creaky
      floorboard and tall window tells a story. But the heart of this home is
      the library: a cozy, light-filled room with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves,
      a sliding ladder, and a worn leather armchair by the window. In a city
      that never stops moving, this space offers stillness—a personal sanctuary
      where stories from every corner of the world live within arm’s reach. It's
      the perfect blend of urban energy and quiet retreat.
