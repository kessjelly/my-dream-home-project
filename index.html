      <h1>My dream home</h1>
      <p>
        My dream home is a classic New York City brownstone, nestled on a quiet,
        tree-lined street with ivy creeping up its historic façade. There's
        something timeless and grounding about the architecture—each creaky
        floorboard and tall window tells a story. But the heart of this home is
        the library: a cozy, light-filled room with floor-to-ceiling
        bookshelves, a sliding ladder, and a worn leather armchair by the
        window. In a city that never stops moving, this space offers stillness—a
        personal sanctuary where stories from every corner of the world live
        within arms reach. It's the perfect blend of urban energy and quiet
        retreat.
